# PCB Modeling and Analysis Report

## Objectives
This report details the process of technical drawing and modeling of a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) using Ansys Discovery, focusing on the creation and modification of a PCB enclosure to enhance its functionality and efficiency.

## Understanding PCBs
PCBs are essential components in electronic devices, facilitating the connection of various electrical components through copper and silicon layers. They are typically housed within enclosures to maintain their functionality and protect them from external factors.

## Modeling Approach
- The report begins with an analysis of technical drawings and the base model provided by Ansys Innovation Courses.
- The modeling process includes the creation of a capacitor and modifications to the PCB enclosure to improve ventilation, such as adding holes and fans and integrating heat sinks for effective heat dissipation.

## Drawing Process
- The design process starts with a base file, expanding and refining it to meet design specifications.
- Detailed steps are provided for creating components like capacitors and modifying the enclosure to include ventilation enhancements and component installations.

## Reference
- The technical drawings and models used in this report are sourced from Ansys Innovation Courses.
