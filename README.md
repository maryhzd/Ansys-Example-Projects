# FEA Modeling Examples Repository

## Overview
This repository is a collection of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) modeling examples, primarily created using Ansys Discovery. These examples are designed to provide practical insights into FEA modeling, following methodologies and best practices from Ansys Innovation Courses.

## Contents
- **FEA Models:** A variety of FEA models demonstrating different aspects and applications of finite element analysis.
- **Ansys Discovery Files:** Project files and models specifically created in Ansys Discovery, showcasing the tool's capabilities in FEA modeling.


## Acknowledgments
- These examples have been developed by following Ansys Innovation Courses. I acknowledge the educational resources provided by Ansys that have been instrumental in creating these modeling examples.


Thank you for visiting this repository!
